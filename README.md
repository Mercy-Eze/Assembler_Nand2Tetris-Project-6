# Hack Assembler

This is a simple assembly code assembler implemented in Python. It takes assembly code files (.asm) as input and generates corresponding machine code files (.hack).

P.S: This assembler solution is designed for the Nand2Tetris Project 6.

This README provides an overview of the project, including its objective, contract, test programs, and usage instructions. Adjustments can be made as needed to match the specific implementation details.

## Overview
The assembler provided in this repository converts assembly code written in a specific format into machine code. It supports A-instructions (addressing instructions) and C-instructions (computation instructions) commonly found in assembly languages. The assembler translates each instruction into its binary equivalent based on predefined mnemonics and rules.

Objective:
The objective is to translate Hack assembly language programs into Hack binary code. This is a fundamental step in understanding how high-level code is deployed on target hardware platforms and how it can be optimized for better performance.

## Contract (as described in the Project)
When supplied with a Prog.asm file containing valid Hack assembly language code, your assembler should correctly translate it into Hack binary code and store it in a file named Prog.hack, located in the same folder as the source file. If a file with the same name already exists, it should be overridden. The output produced by your assembler must be identical to the output produced by the supplied assembler.

## Test Programs (provided by the project)
It provides four test programs to validate the assembler:
- **Add.asm:** Adds the constants 2 and 3, and puts the result in R0.
- **Max.asm:** Computes max(R0, R1) and puts the result in R2.
- **Rect.asm:** Draws a rectangle at the top-left corner of the screen. The rectangle is 16 pixels wide and R0 pixels high.
- **Pong.asm:** A classical single-player arcade game described in detail in Project 4. This large assembly file will stress-test your assembler.

## Usage

To use the assembler, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Prepare your assembly code files in the `files` list in `assembler.py`. Add the paths to your assembly code files (e.g., `add/Add`, `max/Max`, etc.).

3. Run the assembler script:

4. The assembler will process each assembly code file specified in the `files` list and generate corresponding machine code files in the same directory.

## File Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `Assembler.py`: The main Python script that implements the assembler logic.
- `example.asm`: An example assembly code file for demonstration purposes.
- `example.hack`: The machine code file generated by the assembler from `example.asm`.
- `README.md`: This README file providing information about the project.
